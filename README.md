# GalacticAgeCalculator
##Trivia:)
A nearby orphanage has approached you for help. They recently took in an unusual child who was left at their door. The only info they have is the child’s name (Allie), and that she just turned 3 years old. But judging from the unique silvery color of her skin and antennae on her head, they’re pretty sure she’s not from Earth. Some experts have determined that she came from either Venus, Mars, or Jupiter, but the years on those planets are not measured the same as Earth years. The orphanage would like your help to calculate her age in Earth years, given this info:
A Venus year is 0.62 Earth years
A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years
A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years
